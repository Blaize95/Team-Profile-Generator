# Module 10 Challenge - Team-Profile-Generator

## Description
In this project, I was tasked with creating a team profile generator, which takes user answers regarding a coding team and displays them in a HTML file. This was achieved by using prompts within the Inquirer package and write file functionality. A video showing how to use this application can be viewed using the following link:
